This project is focused on investment power and compount interest.The code asks the user to input their data for initial investment amoumnts, monthly deposits, annual interest and the number of years then the user would be returned year-end balances and year-end earned interest if no additional monthly deposits are made, then  the year-end balances and year-end earned interest based on the monthly deposit value .
The organization with indents and spacing makes the code a lot easier to read. The comments allow me or another person to go back to each step and know what it does for the overall program. Some of the more challenging parts of the code was getting the math correct but after messing with it for some time i was able to get it down. Additionally, i had some trouble creating itterations. I understant them but sometimes have trouble writing them correctly. I was able to get it by refreshing my knowledge in the textbook. 
Some skills i used in this project that will be very important for future projects are the uses of declerations, user interactions (input,output), formatting and itterations . These skills are critical in writing goof code. Im sure now i could improve this code by using functions to minimize the amount of code that sits in the main function.
